Rhubarb is a 'project' 3D engine I (Sergiusz Bazanski) have been working on.
Unless you're curious about ugly C++ code, I'd stay away from it. :D

Main ideas:
	o Based on OpenGL 3.0 core context, meaning no deprecated calls used
	  whatsoever (and that is a Good Thing).
	  
	o As tiny as possible, aiming to be not dependant on any other library. Right
	  now it still requires GLEW, but I'm getting rid of it soon.
	  
	o Portable, at least in theory. Linux context creation is coming sooon.
	
	o Does not get in your way - you can use as much or as little stock classes
	  as you want. The default collection tries to hide details like shader
	  compilation and texture loading away from you, but if you want you can
	  start issuing OpenGL calls like it's 1999.
	
	o Not a Game-specific engine - if you want that, go play with Ogre3D. We're
	  here to render stuff, not to write scene managers or physical objects
	  abstractions. If you want to use this in a game, write this stuff yourself.

Features:
	o Slow and in places unstable .obj loading, but hey, it works.
	o Simple to read and write .model formet which specifies mesh, shader and
	  texture data. New loaders easily writable.
	o Basic objects included: Entity, Camera, Model.

Requirements:
	o An OpenGL 3.0 compatible graphics card.
	o GLEW, either as a static library or a .c source file.

Additional Credits:
	o Hideous (www.hideou.se) and doeke for the Knife model and textures.
